One of our team-mate was on etherscan exploring some transactions and saw an advertisement of https://stake.com/ which was giving a 200% bonus on the first deposit, when our team-mate deposited the 120 USDT into this platform they gave him 360 USDT as the total balance and when our teammate started playing game he was shocked to see that he was only able to play with $1 per game of Play Plinko Online - Pachinko Casino Game on Stake.com and was unable to increase the betting amount beyond $1 coz he was using the bonus scheme of 200% and when he tried to explore and play other games on the platform he got to know that this platform has cheated him under the name of wager limits.

When he tried to withdraw money they showed him this rule list of wager limits which said that if he wanted to withdraw the deposited amount then he have to play $12,300 worth of gameplay this was a big shock for him where he was explained a maths logic by their live support. Thereby, In the hope of getting the deposited money back, he played the game Plinko the entire night and lost all the money.

He was very annoyed by this and that's how RoochCasino was born, which is a combination gamefi and defi all in one platform where new web3 users can play games, perform gambling but have a safe, secure, transparent platform that does not scam any of their users. Also, we wanted to address common issues in traditional gaming platforms.

### Problem
The traditional online gambling industry is plagued by several issues, including:
- **User Adoption:** Existing platforms struggle to bring new users into Web3 due to complex interfaces, complicated wallets, bad UI/UX and difficult infra.

- **Unfair Game Outcomes:** Many platforms manipulate game results, leading to unfair play.

- **High Fees:** Users face exorbitant fees for deposits, withdrawals, and gameplay.

- **Restrictive Withdrawal Policies:** Withdrawal limits and conditions often prevent users from accessing their funds.

- **Bonus Drawbacks:** Misleading bonus schemes trap users with unrealistic wagering requirements.

- **Lack of True Asset Ownership:** Centralized platforms retain control over user assets, limiting their freedom and security.

### Solution
 RoochCasino addresses these problems by offering:
- **Seamless User Adoption:** By building fully on-chain on the Rooch blockchain and super simple UI/UX, we offer an easy, familiar entry point for billions to experience Web3 gaming and gamblingâ€”no external apps, complex wallets, or barriers.

- **Provably Fair Gaming:** Utilizing the aptos on-chain randomness module within the Rooch Ecosystem we ensure all game outcomes are transparent and verifiably fair.

- **Flexible Withdrawal Policies:** Providing users with unrestricted access to their funds.

- **Transparent Bonus Schemes:** Clear and Clean bonus terms without hidden traps.

- **True Asset Ownership:** Decentralized asset management ensures users have full control over their assets.

- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Seamless cross-chain transactions between chains for user ease.

### Key Perspectives
**RoochCasino** offers a multifaceted platform with 2 perspectives:

**1. GameFi - Gaming Aspect:**
- **RoochCasino** is a fully functional on-chain Casino.
- Users can place various types of bets over a range of games but as a POC we have developed Roulette, Mines and Wheel of Spin. 
- Roulette game is based on "European Roulette Rules" More detailed information is presented below every game page, the roulette has **straight, split, street, corner, six line, column, dozen, red, black, high, low, even, and odd.**
- The **roulette wheel** randomly generates winning values.**
- Winnings are automatically calculated and transferred to the users wallet on Rooch Chain.

**2. Defi - Lending Aspect:**
- Users can **deposit Rooch or EVM compatible tokens as collateral to borrow in game currency that is APTC** such that if the user holding is in APT and if APT goes up by 10% then the value of the collateral goes up by 10% and users can enjoy playing games/ gambling without facing any financial losses as the in-game currency(APTC) is stable and has nothing to deal with collateral.
- Facilitates gameplay without the need to sell existing holdings.
- Ensures players have the necessary assets to participate in games seamlessly using real-time asset prices.

**Diverse Game Selection:** A variety of fully on-chain games, including roulette, mines, wheel of luck, blackjack, plinko, and more. As a (POC) Proof of Concept we developed fully on-chain Roulette but a similar model can be applied to introduce the new casino games to the platform.
